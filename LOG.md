# Project Log

This file documents key decisions, changes, and insights throughout the project.

## Date: [Put today's date here - e.g., January 15, 2025]

### Project Setup

- Repository structure created
- Conda environment will be configured (epl-arsenal)
- Initial code files will be created with TODO placeholders
- Using hybrid approach: Jupyter notebooks for exploration, Python scripts for production code

### Decisions Made

- Using conda for environment management (easier for data science packages)
- Using scikit-learn for baseline and Random Forest models
- Time-based train/test split strategy (important to avoid data leakage)
- Feature engineering will use rolling windows of 5 matches

### Next Steps

- [ ] Collect and download EPL data
- [ ] Begin data exploration in notebooks/01_exploration.ipynb
