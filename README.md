# Arsenal EPL Match Outcome Prediction

Predicting Arsenal's English Premier League match outcomes using supervised machine learning.

## Project Overview

This project aims to build and evaluate machine learning models to predict whether Arsenal will win, draw, or lose in upcoming EPL matches. The models are trained on historical match data from multiple seasons and use engineered features based on team performance metrics.
